Guiding principles:

* Holistic understanding
  * For each feature, a student should understand why they are doing a thing, or why it is available. e.g. a link on quizzes explaining why quizzes are a thing, how to use them, what they should get out of them
* Productive outlet for frustration
  * For each feature, a student should have a productive way to channel their frustration. E.g. a link to edit material, a link to report problems.
